Coast Guard Rescue!
A Javascript game that the user interacts with the BOM and the DOM.

1. Input the name of the sailor you want to rescue.  He can't be seen
until you are within 3 spaces of him.

2. Move your ship to any square on the board with the mouse.  The DOM is
updated to draw the ship in the square you click on.

3. To help you find him, use your ears to listen to the sonar.  Higher pings = closer. Lower pings = farther.  The difference is subtle!

4. When you get withion 3 spaces of the stranded sailor, you will see him!

5. Click on him to rescue him! Wait a second while the crew pulls him up!
